        <h1 class="font-semibold mb-4 inline-block">Hi there!</h1>
        <h2 class="font-semibold mb-16">I'm Mariana Massimino, Product Designer</h2>
        <h3 class="font-serif font-light text-[32px] leading-[150%] mb-16">I have learned that making the right questions is sometimes the hardest thing to do</h3>
        <div class="mb-16">
          <h4 class="font-semibold">My skill set</h4>
          <p>My skill set goes from UI design to wireframing, prototyping, user and service flows, data analysis, marketing campaigns and more (I look like a Swiss Army Knife of skills ðŸ˜‹). What that really means is I ask a lot of questions, test ideas fast, and shape solutions that make sense for both users and the business.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-16">
          <h4 class="font-semibold">The tool box</h4>
          <p class="mb-8">I used to have a funny paragraph listing all the tools I know how to use, but hereâ€™s the thing: tools are just a means to an end. They donâ€™t define you as a professionalâ€”though they do say something about your curiosity and adaptability. And yes, Iâ€™ve mastered plenty of tools (probably too many ðŸ™ƒ)â€”some I still use every day, others that came and went.</p>
          <p>Now, with AI in the mix, picking up a new toolâ€”or even setting up a process to take care of the repetitive stuffâ€”has never been easier. But again, none of that really matters if youâ€™re not asking the right question.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="font-serif font-light text-[32px] leading-[150%] mb-16">The truth is, tools are just there to make the process smoother, save me time, and let me focus on what really matters: finding the right solutions.</h3>
        <div class="mb-10">
          <h4 class="font-semibold">Working together</h4>
          <p>I like to think that all these flattering statements about me arenâ€™t just my own perceptionâ€”theyâ€™re a collaboration: a dash of self-esteem ðŸ™ˆ mixed with plenty of input from the people I work with ðŸ¤©</p>
